-Fixed a Bug where the cursor was blinking when looking around in the Viewport or the cursor was visible the entire time
-Added Parent and Children functionality
-Copper Engine now builds with nearly no Warnings (stupid shared pointers)
-Major cleanup of some code

-Transform.parent is a pointer to transform of this transforms parent, If equal to nullptr it means it doesn't have a Parent
-Transform.object a SHARED pointer to the Transforms Objects
-Transform.NumOfChildren an int of how many Children this Transform has
-Transform.children a PRIVATE vector of IDs of all the Children objects
-Transform.AddChild(Transform* transform) Adds a Transform as a child of this Transform
-Transform.RemoveChild(int index) Removes the children[index] child
-Transform.RemoveChild(Transform* transform) Finds the Child and removes it WARNING: This Loops over all of the children, might
 be resource heavy if you have too many children!
-Transform.GetChild(int index) Returns a Pointer to the Child at the index Transform
-Transform.GlobalPosition() returns a Vector3 that is the Transforms Global Worl Position
-Transform.position is now Local to the Parents Global Position

-Vector2, 3, 4, UI and Color now have static Variables of zero, one, red, green, etc instead of functions
-Transform now has variables for forward, right, etc instead of functions, lowering the amount of math

-Scene.Update now loops through every Object instead of looping over them multiple times looking for a different Component
-SceneCamera now doesn't calculate the Right directional vector (for some reason it did even if it didn't have to)

-Drag an Object and Drop it on another one which will make the first object a child of the second
-Drag Objects into the empty part of the SceneHierarchy UI making it's parent nullptr
-When dragging an Object onto another it will change it's position so that it stay in the same Place

-Bugs
-When an Object has a parent that has a different rotation the Transform gets funky - FIXED
-SceneView Breaks if there are zero or one Objects - FIXED
-When Dragging an Object onto a nother it won't change it's rotation
-When building Copper Engine in Release If statements with no braces containing only Log functions will result in a warning dues
 to the Log function being empty since it's in release mode
