22/03/2023 22:19 - I just had the biggest exam of my life, and I may have fucked it up
                   ... just a bit. But the grind never stops

-Completely replaced the ECS with a new rewritten version of CopperECS (the CopperECS will get this version soon)
-Instead of Objects, we now have Entities

-changed some variables that should be private to be private (Component::transform, Object::id, etc)

-Added Mouse Axises (Horizontal and Vertical mouse movements expressed in floats)
 NOTE: THEY MIGHT NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY BE CAREFUL

-Removed (temporaryrialrirlyi) the feature to add multiple components of the same type to the same Entity
-Removed (however you spell that word) moving and reararring the Entities in the Scene Hierarchy

-Finished the Cleanup. FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!
