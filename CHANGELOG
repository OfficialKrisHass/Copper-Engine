-Moved the YAML implementations of Copper Wrappers into Wrappers.h so that editor can now
 Write and read them to and from a file

-Changed the Frame Buffer so that now the color attachment is RGB instead of RGBA

-Changed the Renderer::Render functionto Renderer::RenderFrame
-Added Renderer::EndFrame and moved the end of the Frame (clearing the vertices in the Renderer VAO) in there
-Renderer::EndFrame gets called before the frame ends in Engine.h

-Added the Render function to Scene, this allows you to Render the Scene with a camera you've
 specified to the FrameBuffer that was bound last

-Added a bool render parameter to Scene::Update, if this is true then the Scene will be rendered from a camera
 the scene has found in the Scene
-Added bool renderScene to the EngineData struct in Engine.h, this bool is passed into the Scene::Update function
 as the render parameter.
-Added SetRenderScene function that sets EngineData::renderScene to the value specified

-Moved the Resizing of the Engine FBO and the Scene Cam into SetWindowSize so that they are resized when you call the
 function and not the next frame

-Removed Update() from camera Class

-Fixed a weird bug where the component returned by Object::GetComponent() would have an invalid random object pointer

-Fixed a typo, SceneCamera is now inside the Editor Namespace
-SceneCamera::Update() now calls transform->Update()

-Fixed the Warnings in Properties.cpp with casting types into types of lower size

-Moved the Scene Camera to be inside the Project class since it belongs there
-Project now saves the Position, rotation and Scene Camera data into the Project file and loads it when Loading a new project

-Added Editor::GetViewportSize() which returns the viewportsize (obviously du-du-duh)

-Added the Game Panel, which renders the Engine FBO if the scene has a cam, if not, it displays a message "No camera available!"

-Added the viewport's own FBO to EditorData called viewportFBO
-Also added UVector2I gamePanelSize that is, you guessed it, the size of the Game Panel Window

-Editor::RenderViewport now doesn't call SetWindowSize because changing the size of the Viewport window only affects the
 Viewport window and not the actualy Engine
-Before displaying the Viewport, we Bind viewportFBO Clear it and render the scene (using Scene::Render) from the perspective of the 
 Project's Scene Camera, unbind viewportFBO and after all of that, render the viewportFBO colorAttachment
