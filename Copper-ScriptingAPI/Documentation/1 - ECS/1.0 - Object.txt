ECS - Object

1.0.0 - What is an Object:
-An Object is an actual object in a game (a car, gun, but also triggers and camera) and in Copper
 Engine we have a class representing the Object called, as you guessed Object. This class stores
 mostly properties as this class is just a wrapper for the internal C++ Object that actually does
 all of the work so every piece of data needs to be retrieved instead of stored in the actual class.

1.0.1 - name
-Object.name is a property that as you might've guessed is the name of the object as a string.

1.0.2 - transform
-Object.transform is a property of the Object's transform. Every object in Copper Engine has a
 component called Transform, this component stores mostly data about the Object's position, rotation
 and scale, but it also stores some data about relation to other Objects (such as parent,
 localPosition, etc). Object.transform doesn't have a setter because the Transform never changes,
 only it's data does.
