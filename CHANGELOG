-Reworked the Scene Serialization and Deserialization.
-Added a system to allow the code to be able to deserialize older versions.

-Added a Version struct, this struct is just simply a container to hold the version data. Currently it has 4 variables
-stage, a string indicating the stage (Beta, full Release, Dev, etc), and 3 unsigned integers, major which is the major
 release of the stage, minor which are the bug fixes and patches for the said major version, and dev which is for the dev
 branch.
-It also contains an unsinged integer sceneVersion, which is what version of the De/Serializer should the Scenes use.
-Also I added defines for the Versions (VERSION_X, x can be STAGE, MAJOR, MINOR, or DEV) and for the scene version
 (SCENE_VERSION) too. They are just defines for the current version.

-Removed Transform::numOfChildren. Why did it even exist ? It was always equal to the size of the children vector. What was
 I thinking wtf

-Added a new C++ project, Copper Launcher. Which is an app that allows you to create new projects easily, and open the
 correct project without having to do it from the Editor.
-The Launcher is really barebone, and the code is really messy, I just wanted to make a base for later. It works, but it might
 not work sometimes, so yeah.
-It doesn't worky :c the template it uses to create a new Project is old and outdated which means it doesn't work

-Most of the mentions of Objects (variable and function names) are now replaced with Entity
-Changed the name of the CopperObject class in the C# scripting API to Entity

-Fixed the Mouse Axises
-Added Input::SetCursorLocked function that locks the cursor to the middle of the Screen
-Added a acceptScriptInput bool, if true, C# scripts that call to Input functions (IsKey, IsKeyDown, GetAxis) will return zero
 or false.
-When the Editor Runtime starts, acceptScriptInput is set to true by default, if you press Escape it is set to false
 and if you click the Game Window it is set to true again.
-Finally made a functioning FPS movement script in the Dev Project
