-Renamed the Object class in the C# Scripting API to CopperObject. Before there were problems with the built
 in object keyword (for some reason even though one starts with Uppercase, C# would confuse the two types)

-Added a pointer to the SceneMeta to Properties.cpp

-Made some changes to the Show functions in Properties
-Added ShowObject to show a field that can accept the Drag Drop Payload

-Added function overloads to Set and Get fields from Scripts that have the type CopperObject (and also correctly convert
 it into the C++ Object class)
-Added Serialization and Deserialization for Script Fields of CopperObject type

-Fixed the problem where if you started dragging a node in the Scene Hierarchy it would automatically select that node
